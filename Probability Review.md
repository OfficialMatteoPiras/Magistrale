A probability space has three components: 
1. A sample space Z, which is the set of all possible outcomes of the random process modeled by the probability space; 
2. A family of sets F representing the allowable events, where each set in F is a subset of the sample space Z. Must be a- eld. F Closed under complements: if A F then Ac = A=Z A F Closed under countable unions (and intersections).
3. A probability function (or distribution) D : F satisfying the de nition in next slide. [01]
